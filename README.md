THE BIRTH OF PROJECT BREEZE: BEHIND THE SCENES

TIME DURATION : 1 MONTH
DEADLINE : NOV 15th 2022

This article shows the design of a career network application oriented to university students and employer organisations. During the planning phase of the application, the team adopted an agile process and demonstrate an understanding of software design, UML (Unified Modelling Language) Diagrams, and their applications. Appropriate notations are utilised while modelling the system to their respective diagrams. In making the application, the team adhere to the different artefacts of the software lifecycle. Furthermore, the team investigated the best-suited software architecture for the application and analysed the models from a software- development perspective. Finally, the team documented the outcomes of the work in this technical report.

PERSONAL NOTES ON TEAM AND WORK :

Once the team was allocated, I established contact with the group members with the primary tool of communication was Ms Teams created by team members and secondary through WhatsApp. Since part of the coursework was on the independent week, we manage to progress further via online meetings. The team started to delegate work based on the requirements, and further discussions regarding ambiguities were done in live meetings set up in the Jack Cole Building.

My contribution to the team was working on the business canvas, and code of ethics with the phase 1 and phase 2 analyses. The overall analysis of the system design and the reflection on the process were also initiated by me and then further developed and finally committed by the team. Once the coursework was released, we wanted to get the requirements and the architecture building blocks sorted out before the independent week started as team members might not be available during that week.

During Week 1 and Week 2, the team started to work on Phase 1 and Phase 2, the progress compared to Week 3 and 4 was slower due to understanding the requirements and developing the fundamentals for Project “Breeze”.

My contribution to the report was constructing the report from the early drafts and documenting the work done by the group, each stage of the process was documented and structured to the proper format of a technical report. The team also proof-read each other’s work at every meeting to make sure that nothing that wasn’t irrelevant wasn’t added to the technical report,What was challenging to each other was working on the ambiguities that arose during the project and seeking them together as a team and every individual’s view was necessary for solving them.

The team had a good understanding and the workflow was good among each other. Collaboration was great among the team members, and though we had a small number of delays in the work, it was completed by the next meeting with the team and proofread every step of the way.
All the teammates were able to contribute to their work equally and fairly, everyone did their parts accordingly and some went to the extreme of perfecting their work even after the final proofread was done.

The teammate that particularly stood out was Victor Yuan since this member worked on the core part of the technical report such as the structural class diagram, and behavioural sequence and collaborated on ER modelling. The member worked tirelessly to perfect these parts and wasn’t satisfied after many of his inital drafts of the above topics that he worked on well after when the report was finally committed.
Questions were encouraged within the team, and free thought and speech paved the way for great team collaboration and solving any work or social-related problems (not that there were any).

My experience working with the team was adapting new work culture and understanding how a team works in job places on SCRUM agile framework. What a month of coursework thought me was that the right team could create wonders for any project. (P.S I HOPE THE "ALL NIGHTERS" PAID OFF)..
