## Description :

* This repository showcases the design of a career network application geared towards university students and employer organizations. Our team employed an agile process during the planning phase of the application and demonstrated an understanding of software design, UML (Unified Modelling Language) diagrams, and their applications. Appropriate notations were utilized while modeling the system to their respective diagrams. 

* We adhered to the different artifacts of the software lifecycle in making the application. Furthermore, we investigated the best-suited software architecture for the application and analyzed the models from a software development perspective. Finally, we documented the outcomes of the work in this technical report.

## Azure DevOps Integration

We used <strong> Azure DevOps as part of our SCRUM-based Agile methodology </strong>. You can find our project on (https://dev.azure.com/st-andrews/Project%20Breeze).

## Personal Notes on Team and Work

<ol>
<li> Once the team was allocated, we established contact with each other primarily through Microsoft Teams and secondary through WhatsApp. Since part of the coursework was during the independent week, we progressed further via online meetings. We delegated work based on requirements and further discussed ambiguities during live meetings set up in the Jack Cole Building.

<li> My contribution to the team was working on the business canvas and code of ethics with the Phase 1 and Phase 2 analyses. I initiated the overall analysis of the system design and the reflection on the process, which was further developed and finally committed by the team. We wanted to get the requirements and the architecture building blocks sorted out before the independent week started since team members might not be available during that week.

<li> During Week 1 and Week 2, the team worked on Phase 1 and Phase 2. Progress was slower compared to Week 3 and 4 due to understanding the requirements and developing the fundamentals for Project "Breeze."

<li> My contribution to the report was constructing the report from the early drafts and documenting the work done by the group. Each stage of the process was documented and structured to the proper format of a technical report. The team also proofread each other's work at every meeting to ensure that irrelevant information was not added to the technical report.

<li> The teammate that particularly stood out was Victor Yuan, who worked tirelessly on the core part of the technical report such as the structural class diagram and behavioral sequence and collaborated on ER modeling. Questions were encouraged within the team, and free thought and speech paved the way for great team collaboration and solving any work or social-related problems.
</ol>

<p> My experience working with the team was adapting to a new work culture and understanding how a team works in job places on the SCRUM agile framework. What a month of coursework taught me was that the right team could create wonders for any project. (P.S. I HOPE THE "ALL NIGHTERS" PAID OFF) </p>
